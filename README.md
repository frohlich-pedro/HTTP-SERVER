# webServer
Simple webserver in Java
it was made for my use, i did it for fun, mainly because i dislike node.js, but it wasn't made for running on your site, of course you can use it for your site, i would be so happy to see other people use it, BUT it would require of you to change the path of the 'www' folder,  because as i said, it was made for my use. If you have any suggestion, i'm all ears.
